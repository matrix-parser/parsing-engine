# Matrix Parser

A reliable, robust, and repeatable document parsing engine for parsing data from PDFs of consistent formats. 

## What problem do we solve?

In today's digital world, invoices at supermarkets, bank statements at CAs, and other such documents are shared through PDFs or scanned copies. It is a very tedious task to manually interpret such structured data when there are a huge number of documents and/or entries. You can extract the text using OCR, but how do you distinguish the different rows and columns in the document? That's where our product comes in. You can use our language to write a simple script in our SQL-like language that runs on the OCR results and returns you a CSV file.
